# White-Cheese-Sales-Analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large dataset consisting of over 983,000 records related to sales across various regions, channels, brands, and products. The dataset included complex metrics such as Raw Sales Volume, Extrapolated Sales Volume, and XFactor, which represented the number of similar stores in the market universe.

### Key achievements of this project included:

Data Processing and Insight Generation: Analyzed sales performance by region, channel, brand, and product to uncover key trends and insights. I used the XFactor to extrapolate data and assess market potential across different regions and channels.
Interactive Dashboard Design: Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provided a high-level overview of sales performance while enabling users to drill down into specific regions, channels, and products for more detailed insights.
Drill-Through Functionality: Implemented drill-through features in Power BI, allowing users to explore granular data directly from the summary visuals. This enhanced the dashboard's usability, providing an intuitive and dynamic user experience.
Visualization Optimization: Designed and optimized visualizations to fit within the limited space of the Power BI dashboard while ensuring all key data points were effectively represented. Used various visualization types, including bar charts, line graphs, and tables, to present complex data in an easily digestible format.
